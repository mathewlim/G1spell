# Spelling Adventure Game

## 🎯 Purpose

This game is designed to help children or language learners improve their spelling skills in a fun and interactive way. Users are presented with sentences where a key word is missing. They must form the correct word by clicking jumbled letters. The game provides visual and auditory feedback to encourage learning through play.
